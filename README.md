SendHubAPIExample
=================

An very simple example of how to use the SendHub API to add, delete, and modify contacts.  This example also includes the ability to send a message to one of your contacts.  Username and API key are hardcoded so be aware of this!  Feel free to abuse my API key though, I don't actually use SendHub.

This example should be easy to understand.  Almost every line is commented, explaining exactly what each line does and why I do it.
