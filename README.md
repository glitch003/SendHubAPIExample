SendHubAPIExample
=================

*New README*
This app is now a cat-facts sender.  It allows you to enter a SendHub API key and username and it will send a cat fact to a contact when you press "Send Message".

Put your sendhub username and API key in the file APIConstants.h.

Note: you must save a contact before you can send a message to them!  This will be fixed in the future.









*Old README - No longer correct*
An very simple example of how to use the SendHub API to add, delete, and modify contacts.  This example also includes the ability to send a message to one of your contacts.  Username and API key are hardcoded so be aware of this!  Feel free to abuse my API key though, I don't actually use SendHub.

This example should be easy to understand.  Almost every line is commented, explaining exactly what each line does and why I do it.
